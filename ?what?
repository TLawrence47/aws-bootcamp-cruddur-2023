This Bootcamp consists of watching the live Youtube sessions/follow alongs. OK ✅

It isn't for beginners but its definitely a Cloud project that will go the resume to express some Cloud knowledge and usage. They register this as an intermediate level
  project. I... am definitely a beginner and still studying for my AWS CCP
  
The story of the bootcamp is that we are constructing a "micro-blogging platform" titled CRUDDUR for a business that has hired us. Think Twitter or Tumblr.

Following the Youtube playlist, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b8SvQHc4Pk&list=PLBfufR7vyJJ7k25byhRXJldB5AiwgNnWv, the prereqs included signing up for several websites.
  One being this site GitHub. Everytime I've been on this site, someone has told me where to go/what to click on. I am not familiar with what I would do with this site 
  nor do I understand what it is for or why I would use this outside of this specific use. ✅          Gitpod, Codespaces, Momemto, Honeycomb, Rollbar...¯\_(ツ)_/¯
   
There's a student portal where the instruction checklist is located and thats consists of supplemental Youtube videos (there's alot of "sub-videos") to get a better
definition of the AWS service. After the checklist is a homework submission summary (with a specific definition). The portal also hosts the homework list and quiz 
questions. OK✅
Also what's considered homework is logging into Github or Gitpod (I'm not clear on the differences) and documenting (they call it journaling)
